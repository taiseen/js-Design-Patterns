# SOLID Principles
* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

```
Applying SOLID principles can lead to code that is 
more modular, 
maintainable and 
extensible, 
and it can make it easier for developers to work collaboratively on a codebase.
