## Learning concept as bird view...

```
Design Patterns breaks down 23 different approaches to 
address recurring problems that programmers face.

which are categorized as 
Creational patterns ==> how objects are created 🍼👶
Structural patterns ==> how objects relate to each other & 🧑‍🤝
Behavioral patterns ==> how objects communicate with each other 📶📞
```


```
Gang of Four patterns include 23 design patterns 
& divided those in 3 categories :-

creational patterns ==> different ways to create objects 🍼👶
structural patterns ==> relationships between these objects 🧑‍🤝
behavioral patterns ==> interaction or communication between these objects 📶📞
```


```
1. Singleton (DB driver)
2. Facade (building front view)
3. Bridge/Connector/Adapter (APIs)
4. Strategy (notification to sales clients)
5. Pub-Sub/Observer (event based)
```


```
Design Patterns are really interesting,
because they're not just like algorithms... 
that you can copy & paste from stack overflow 
you actually need to use your 🧠 brain to implement them...

but when used improperly, 
they can add additional complexity & boilerplate to a codebase.

regardless knowing how to recognize Design Patterns 
will help you level up as a programmer...
```

## Creational Patterns:-
* Singleton ==> using if() logical checking, create only a single object for you...
* Prototype ==> inheritance concept
* Builder   ==> step by step small methods() chaining, build object for you...
* Factory   ==> function() or method() with if/switch, create object for you...


## Structural Patterns:-
* Facade
* Proxy

## Behavioral Patterns:-
* Iterator
* Observer
* Mediator
* State

```
Its not important to understand that...
How Design Patterns work!!!? rather than
How/Which kind of problem this Design Pattern solve...
```

```
implementing the Undo feature one of them is the "Momento Pattern"
so a design pattern shows you how you should structure your classes and 
how these classes should talk to each other
