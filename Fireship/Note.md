## Learning concept as bird view...

```
Design Patterns breaks down 23 different approaches to 
address recurring problems that programmers face.

which are categorized as 
Creational patterns ==> how objects are created 
Structural patterns ==> how objects relate to each other & 
Behavioral patterns ==> how objects communicate with each other
```


```
Design Patterns are really interesting,
because they're not just like algorithms... 
that you can copy & paste from stack overflow 
you actually need to use your ðŸ§  brain to implement them...

but when used improperly, 
they can add additional complexity & boilerplate to a codebase.

regardless knowing how to recognize Design Patterns 
will help you level up as a programmer...
```

## Creational Patterns:-
* Singleton ==> using if() logical checking, create only a single object for you...
* Prototype ==> inheritance concept
* Builder   ==> step by step small methods() chaining, build object for you...
* Factory   ==> function() or method(), create object for you...


## Structural Patterns:-
* Facade
* Proxy

## Behavioral Patterns:-
* Iterator
* Observer
* Mediator
* State
