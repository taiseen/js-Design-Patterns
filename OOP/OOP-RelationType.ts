/*
OOP ==> Relationship Types

One of the advantages of Object-Oriented programming language is code reuse. 
This reusability is possible due to the relationship b/w the classes. 

OR Reusability is feasible because various types of relationships 
that can be implemented among classes.

OOP generally support 4 types of relationships that are:
inheritance,  
composition,
aggregation &
association.
Dependency


All these relationship is based on 
"is a" relationship, 
"has-a" relationship & 
"part-of" relationship.
