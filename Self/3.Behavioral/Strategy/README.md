# Strategy pattern 

```
The Strategy pattern encapsulates alternative algorithms (or strategies) for a particular task. 
It allows a method to be swapped out at runtime by any other method (strategy) 
without the client realizing it. 
Strategy is a group of algorithms that are interchangeable.


So, Strategy Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern that -
enables selecting an algorithm at runtime
```


# When To Use

* Must use this pattern, when most of your classes have related behaviors.
* When there are conditional statements around a several algorithm which are related between them.
* When you need use several algorithms which have different variations.


## Some use-case of using this pattern...
1. Payment Processing 
2. Sorting Algorithms
3. File Compression
4. Image Processing Filters
5. Routing and Navigation
6. Logging Strategies
7. Text Editing
8. Authentication Strategies
9. Data Validation
10. Game AI
11. Transportation Methods
12. Caching Strategies
13. Encryption/Decryption Algorithms
14. Task Scheduling
